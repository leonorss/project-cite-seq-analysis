abstract = "The bulk tissue RNA sequencing technique measures the average gene expression of potentially heterogeneous cellular subsets of human skin. However, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables both profiling of gene expression measurements at a single-cell resolution and identification of cellular heterogeneity. This recent technical advance has broadened the understanding of many aspects of skin biology, such as development, oncogenesis, and immunopathogenesis. However, due to the low number of mRNAs detectable in an individual cell and the alteration of transcriptomes during sample preparation, scRNA-seq data are often extremely noisy. Moreover, unstandardized methodologies for sample preparation, capturing, and bioinformatic analysis (e.g., batch correction or integration) hamper reliable inter-study comparisons. Nevertheless, sophisticated bioinformatic analysis and integrative omics-based approaches are making up for these limitations. Here, we discuss both the advantages and technical challenges of scRNA-seq, a promising tool opening new horizons in dermatological research."

abstract = "Summary
To define the cellular composition and architecture of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), we combined single-cell RNA sequencing with spatial transcriptomics and multiplexed ion beam imaging from a series of human cSCCs and matched normal skin. cSCC exhibited four tumor subpopulations, three recapitulating normal epidermal states, and a tumor-specific keratinocyte (TSK) population unique to cancer, which localized to a fibrovascular niche. Integration of single-cell and spatial data mapped ligand-receptor networks to specific cell types, revealing TSK cells as a hub for intercellular communication. Multiple features of potential immunosuppression were observed, including T regulatory cell (Treg) co-localization with CD8 T cells in compartmentalized tumor stroma. Finally, single-cell characterization of human tumor xenografts and in vivo CRISPR screens identified essential roles for specific tumor subpopulation-enriched gene networks in tumorigenesis. These data define cSCC tumor and stromal cell subpopulations, the spatial niches where they interact, and the communicating gene networks that they engage in cancer."

	abstract = {Cellular heterogeneity in gene expression is driven by cellular processes, such as cell cycle and cell-type identity, and cellular environment such as spatial location. The cell cycle, in particular, is thought to be a key driver of cell-to-cell heterogeneity in gene expression, even in otherwise homogeneous cell populations. Recent advances in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) facilitate detailed characterization of gene expression heterogeneity and can thus shed new light on the processes driving heterogeneity. Here, we combined fluorescence imaging with scRNA-seq to measure cell cycle phase and gene expression levels in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). By using these data, we developed a novel approach to characterize cell cycle progression. Although standard methods assign cells to discrete cell cycle stages, our method goes beyond this and quantifies cell cycle progression on a continuum. We found that, on average, scRNA-seq data from only five genes predicted a cell's position on the cell cycle continuum to within 14\% of the entire cycle and that using more genes did not improve this accuracy. Our data and predictor of cell cycle phase can directly help future studies to account for cell cycle–related heterogeneity in iPSCs. Our results and methods also provide a foundation for future work to characterize the effects of the cell cycle on expression heterogeneity in other cell types.},
