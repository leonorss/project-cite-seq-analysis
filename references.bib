abstract = "The bulk tissue RNA sequencing technique measures the average gene expression of potentially heterogeneous cellular subsets of human skin. However, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables both profiling of gene expression measurements at a single-cell resolution and identification of cellular heterogeneity. This recent technical advance has broadened the understanding of many aspects of skin biology, such as development, oncogenesis, and immunopathogenesis. However, due to the low number of mRNAs detectable in an individual cell and the alteration of transcriptomes during sample preparation, scRNA-seq data are often extremely noisy. Moreover, unstandardized methodologies for sample preparation, capturing, and bioinformatic analysis (e.g., batch correction or integration) hamper reliable inter-study comparisons. Nevertheless, sophisticated bioinformatic analysis and integrative omics-based approaches are making up for these limitations. Here, we discuss both the advantages and technical challenges of scRNA-seq, a promising tool opening new horizons in dermatological research."

abstract = "Summary
To define the cellular composition and architecture of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), we combined single-cell RNA sequencing with spatial transcriptomics and multiplexed ion beam imaging from a series of human cSCCs and matched normal skin. cSCC exhibited four tumor subpopulations, three recapitulating normal epidermal states, and a tumor-specific keratinocyte (TSK) population unique to cancer, which localized to a fibrovascular niche. Integration of single-cell and spatial data mapped ligand-receptor networks to specific cell types, revealing TSK cells as a hub for intercellular communication. Multiple features of potential immunosuppression were observed, including T regulatory cell (Treg) co-localization with CD8 T cells in compartmentalized tumor stroma. Finally, single-cell characterization of human tumor xenografts and in vivo CRISPR screens identified essential roles for specific tumor subpopulation-enriched gene networks in tumorigenesis. These data define cSCC tumor and stromal cell subpopulations, the spatial niches where they interact, and the communicating gene networks that they engage in cancer."
