## Project Description
We investigated the difference in cell types representation in samples from healthy skin, squamous cell carcinoma and actinik keratosis samples. We used tools available in R to run quality check, reduction, normalization and clustering of our data.

## Data
Data were provided by the Universitätsspital Zürich

## Context
This project is part of the course Statistical Analysis of High-Throughput Genomic and Transcriptomic Data (STA426) given at the University of Zürich (UZH) during the Fall semester 2020 by [Dr. Hubert Rehrauer](http://www.fgcz.ch/the-center/people/rehrauer.html) and [Prof. Dr. Mark Robinson](https://robinsonlabuzh.github.io/).
